# 🧠 Custom LLM from Scratch

Build your own Large Language Model from the ground up! This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline to train, fine-tune, and deploy a custom LLM tailored for specific domains or tasks.

## 🔧 Features

- **Tokenizer Creation**: Implement Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and train custom vocabularies.
- **Model Architecture**: Develop a Transformer-based model using PyTorch.
- **Training Pipeline**: Set up a scalable training loop with mixed-precision support and multi-GPU compatibility.
- **Fine-tuning**: Adapt your base model to domain-specific datasets with ease.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure performance using Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and domain-specific benchmarks.
- **Inference**: Utilize optimized inference scripts with beam search and top-k sampling.
- **Deployment-ready**: Export models as ONNX or integrate into APIs using FastAPI.

## 📚 Use Cases

- Domain-specific assistants (e.g., legal, medical, finance)
- Chatbots and question answering systems
- Code generation and documentation
- Text summarization and rewriting

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python
- Tensorflow
- HuggingFace Datasets (optional)
- WandB / TensorBoard for training logs
- FastAPI for deployment
